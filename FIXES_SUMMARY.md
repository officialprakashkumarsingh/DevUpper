# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the fixes and improvements made to the Dart Flutter application to create a Cursor AI-like coding agent experience.

## Recent Major Fixes (Latest)

### 1. Task Completion Git Operations Integration ✅
**Problem**: When tasks were completed, there was no way to commit, push, pull, or merge changes to update the repository.
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `TaskCard` widget to show git operations section for completed tasks
- Added quick action buttons for Commit, Push, Pull, and More operations
- Integrated `GitOperationsWidget` as a dialog when task is completed
- Added automatic commit message generation based on completed task details
- Enhanced `GitService` with missing `push()`, `pull()`, and `merge()` methods

### 2. AI-Powered Task Type Detection ✅
**Problem**: Task creation dialog required manual task type selection instead of using AI to determine it automatically.
**Solution**:
- Added `determineTaskType()` method in `AIService` that analyzes task title and description
- Created intelligent keyword-based fallback logic for task type detection
- Updated task creation dialog with toggle switch for AI vs manual type selection
- Made task type optional in task creation, with AI determining it when not specified
- Added smart UI that shows "AI will determine task type automatically" message

### 3. Smart Task Suggestions ✅
**Problem**: Users had to come up with task ideas manually.
**Solution**:
- Added AI-powered task suggestion generation in task creation dialog
- Added sparkle icon button to generate smart task suggestions
- Implemented repository-based task suggestions (placeholder for future AI analysis)
- Added loading states and error handling for suggestion generation

### 4. Enhanced Git Operations ✅
**Problem**: Git operations were limited and didn't integrate with completed tasks.
**Solution**:
- Added automatic commit message generation based on completed task details
- Enhanced git operations widget to accept completed task context
- Added push, pull, merge operations to git service
- Improved error handling and success feedback for git operations
- Added visual indicators for git operations needed after task completion

### 5. Intelligent Workflow Integration ✅
**Problem**: The workflow didn't feel like an integrated AI coding assistant.
**Solution**:
- Tasks now automatically detect if code changes were made
- Completed tasks with code changes show prominent git operations section
- AI suggests appropriate commit messages based on task type and description
- Seamless integration between task completion and repository updates
- Added metadata tracking for tasks that require git operations
